#ifndef SINGLETON_H

/**
 * The Singleton template class is a helper class that stores all the code
 * necessary to implement a Singleton class.
 *
 * To make a class a singleton, there is a simple set of instructions:
 * -# Make the class a subclass of singleton, using itself as the template class
 *    - For instance, a singleton class Car would be declared like so:<br>
 *    <code>class Car : public Singleton<Car></code>
 * -# Instead of implementing a constructor, use initialize()
 *    - Declaring a constructor for your singleton would result in a
 *      compile-time error, so use initialize() for all your parameter
 *      initialization.
 * -# Instead of implementing a destructor, use finish()
 * -# Gaze upon your new singleton class with pride. Use getInstance() to grab
 *    a singleton instance, and use destroy() to force a cleanup of an existing
 *    singleton
 *
 * \todo At the time of writing, there is no static "manager" to clean up
 *       all instantiated singletons, but there certainly should be!
