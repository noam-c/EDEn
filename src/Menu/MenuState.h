/**
 * The in-game menu goes through many different states based on choices that the player makes
 * and the panels that appear. The states need to be tracked in a FIFO order so that cancelling
 * one menu state returns the user to the previous one.
 *
 * In order to accomplish this, the in-game menu is split into multiple menu-specific GameStates called MenuStates.
 * All the MenuStates share the same GUI elements, except for the menu pane on display. As a result, these shared elements
 * are combined into a MenuShell, which is passed around between all the menu states to facilitate reuse of existing GUI objects.
 *
 * To create a new menu action, simply create a subclass of MenuState, and then create and set a menu pane in the subclass
 * constructor. Ensure that the menu shell (and other common data) is passed up to the MenuState through its constructor.
 * Override the virtual methods below to handle user input and add any special logic or drawing.
