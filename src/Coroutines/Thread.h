/**
 * A Thread is, in this case, an object that can yield, resume or block.
 * The typical scenario for a Thread object is a resumption (with the amount of
 * time since the last frame passed in), followed by blocking or by destruction.
 *
 * The class name is a misnomer; Thread objects do not actually use "threads" in
 * the typical sense. They are semi-coroutines, running serially, resuming
 * and yielding. They do not have their own threads of execution.
